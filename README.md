CAMEL : Czochralski Apparatus for Modeling Efficient Lattice growth
=====

## Introduction ##
The Czochralski (Cz) process is a method of growing single crystal ingots most commonly used for semiconductors such as silicon. This process is widely used commercially and thus further research 
has significant financial incentives. 
</br>
The aim of this project is to develop a multiscale, multiphysics model for the Czochralski process. The multiphysics simulations will encompass heat transfer, phase field methods, and computational fluid dynamics utilizing the Navier-Stokes equations, among other physics capabilities.
</br></br>
This project is made possible by the development of [The Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE)](https://github.com/idaholab/moose)
